# Icon Files Needed

This extension requires icon files in the following sizes:

- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be PNG files with a design representing the extension (e.g., AI/robot icon combined with LinkedIn branding colors).

For development purposes, you can:
1. Create simple square PNG files with the extension name
2. Use any icon generator online
3. Design custom icons in image editing software

The icons should follow Firefox extension guidelines:
- Use clear, simple designs
- Make them recognizable at small sizes
- Use appropriate contrast
- Consider both light and dark theme compatibility

Recommended colors:
- Primary: #0077b5 (LinkedIn blue)
- Secondary: #ffffff (white)
- Accent: #005885 (darker blue)
